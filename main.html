          <h2><u>Introduction:</u></h2>
          <p>For Team Enigma’s final project, we decided to watch several<br>
             episodes of the Office to find scenes that demonstrated various<br>
             management principles we learned about throughout the quarter. The<br>
             principles we decided to focus on are based in leadership, human resources,<br>
             decision making, conflict/negotiation, and motivation.

          <h2><u>Leadership Delegation:</u></h2>
          <p>In this scene of the Office, Michael (Steve Carell), is questioned by Jan <br>
             about his leadership methods when he states he lets everyone go home when<br>
             he leaves the office for an hour. Jan questions why he would do such a<br>
             thing, and Michael then admits his employees don’t get much work done<br>
             without him being in the office. He then changes his statement to say<br>
             that he knows how to delegate and that the employees get work done while<br>
             he is away.<br><br><br><br>

          <h2><u>Performance Review:</u></h2>
          <p>In a previous scene before this clip, Michael (Steve Carell) announced that<br>
            it was, “performance evaluation day.” Essentially, Michael used these<br>
            performance review slots of time to gain personal information and advice from<br>
            employees in order to judge their performance. Of course, this is the complete<br>
            wrong way to conduct performance interviews. The employee Michael is<br>
            interviewing starts to kiss Michael’s ass, which he then states at the end of<br>
            the scene, he said it all just to get his bonus.<br><br><br><br>

          <h2><u>Decision Making:</u></h2>
          <p>This scene shows that the numbers/formula used in their budget calculation<br>
            was incorrect. This is an example of using a bad decision making process to<br>
            approve such a bad budget.<br><br><br><br>

          <h2><u>Incentives:</u></h2>
          <p>This scene shows the manager trying to motivate employees by implementing<br>
            a “reward/point,” system. Of course, this scene shows a lame attempt at<br>
            implementing such a system.<br><br><br><br>

          <h2><u>Conflict Negotiation:</u></h2>
          <p>In this scene, the office team is trying to convince their coworker to<br>
            quit talking like Yoda-like speech and short words. The team effectively<br>
            convinces him to use normal speech again by using the management<br>
            principle of conflict/negotiation.<br><br><br><br>

      <h2><u>Case Study:</u></h2>
      <div class="hidden">
        <p>In this <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/07/why-arent-you-delegating">article</a>, two short case studies were given as examples on how to have better delegation. A few key points were to hire people that could be delegated to, and to create a win-win-win situation. In the first case study concerning the former key point, executive director Chloe Drew explains that she looks for people who are ready to take ownership on the first day of working to hire. This is due to the fact that Chloe knows she’s not the best at delegation, and instead of trying to do all the work herself, she has learned to rely on others to get work done. In the second case study concerning a win-win-win situation, managing director Russell Su learned to delegate well by observing others. In his case, when one of the department heads he was in charge of didn’t cooperate well since he didn’t agree with the goals, Russell had no choice but to replace him. Through this, he learned that it was crucial to delegate to those who agreed and were on board with the goals.

        <p>In this <a href="https://coachcampus.com/coach-portfolios/case-studies/wai-han-ho-a-case-of-improving-job-performance-at-the-workplace/">case study</a>, a career coach was consulted by a senior manager named Clara, who worked in a multinational organization. Clara was recently promoted to a new position that required her to make reports to a new line manager. However, she is unable to develop a harmonious relationship with the line manager, resulting in a loss of confidence and a decrease in performance. To help with this, the coach first asked Clara to identify the top 8 priorities in life, so that she may see her current satisfaction versus her target, and to notice that there are many other areas in life that she is doing well in. She was then asked to create a list of values that were important to her to review. After this process, Clara was asked to give examples of moments when she had difficulties with the line manager. From an outsider’s perspective, the coach was able to give Clara a different point of view to assess the situation, and Clara was able to identify some areas where actions could be taken to improve not only her own team’s performance, but also her relationship with the line manager. From thereon out, Clara was ready with a plan to increase her performance and approach the line manager.

        <p>Chardon et al. (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016974399180064W">here</a>) conducted an experiment which evaluated 49 formulations on 5 criteria, with the aim of optimizing a textiles formulation. The Pareto optimality concept was found to be effective for simple bicriteria cases, however more advanced techniques such as ELECTRE and PROMETHEE were required to take more criteria into account. The PROMETHEE method, coupled with the GAIA visualization technique was determined to be a good tool in multicriteria decision making.
          Optimization is a general problem in experimental chemistry and can involve multiple criteria that may be in conflict with each other. As a result, chemometricians often use different strategies to solve the problem. One method involves assigning weights to the criteria and then combining them with a weighted sum, while the other involves defining a threshold for one criterion and optimizing the other within that area. No matter the strategy chosen, it is possible to find an optimal decision between multiple criteria.

        <p>This <a href="https://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/file/999b0d07-e1f3-4419-859b-ef4edef71299/1/PDF%20%28Published%20version%29.pdf">research project</a> explored how staff at non-profit organizations view intrinsic and extrinsic rewards as sources of motivation. Data was collected through a survey asking participants to rate different statements regarding intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. Statistical analysis showed that intrinsic rewards, such as the achievements of their clients, work/life balance, and enjoyment of their job, were seen as important for motivating staff.
          The study examines the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards on motivation in Not-for-Profit organizations. It looks at the importance of intrinsic factors in the motivation of people to remain in the NFP sector, despite being paid less than those in the private sector. Intrinsic motivation is seen as more important to those whose income is above subsistence level, while extrinsic rewards are viewed as incentives provided by others. The paper concludes that both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards have an effect on motivation, but that a focus on intrinsic rewards is important as employees in the NFP sector are motivated by more than just money.

        <p>In this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/diagnosing-team-conflict-case-study-part-1-2-mike-gellman-m-s-acc/">case study</a>, it is shown that understanding the inner workings of the causes of team conflict and developing a systemic approach to prevent regressing into bad habits is vital to resolving team conflict. A Claims team of eight employees had trouble getting along, and much of the clashes between team members occurred through small transgressions; much of which happened with the company’s two vehicles used for field work. To resolve this issue, an advisor was called in, and talked to each team member individually. Upon discussing with each of them and finding much of the underlying areas that would ignite many team arguments, the advisor came up with a plan that would aid the team’s interpersonal dynamics to develop a more positive manner within the workplace. This plan consisted of: acknowledging the problems, establishing agreement in creating a better environment, improving feedback skills, discussing and reworking problematic processes, and finally, establishing accountability and positive reinforcement. These methods were successful in resolving much of the problems within the Claims team, and it is said that even 10 years later, employees still stick to the plan to settle conflict.
